<h1 style="color: green;">HUMBLE REQUEST</h1>
<h2><em>Dear Mr. Vincent</em>,</h2>
<p>

I wanted to express my gratitude for your teaching methods, which I find engaging and effective.
    <br>However, I wanted to respectfully suggest that perhaps we could revisit the class duration.

<em><b>When our sessions exceed five hours, I find it challenging to retain the information we've covered.
    <br>The sheer volume of material becomes overwhelming, making it difficult for me (and possibly others)
    to fully absorb and retain it</b>.</em>

    <br>Would it be possible to consider breaking up the longer sessions or adjusting the pace to better
    accommodate our learning needs?
 </p>
<p><b>Thank you for your dedication and understanding.</b></p>

Sincerely,
<b><em>JAMES</em></b>
